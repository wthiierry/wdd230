                This exemplifies Hick's Law in action. The website has been intricately crafted to guide visitors
                towards taking actions, such as purchasing the product or delving deeper into learning about it. The
                website exhibits a high level of sophistication in its design and functionality.

            <p>
                This serves as an illustration of Visual Hierarchy principles at work. The company's name takes center
                stage, standing out as the most prominent element, akin to hot breaking news. As you scroll down the
                page, additional news items become visible, yet they are presented in a relatively smaller size compared
                to the headline news at the top. Furthermore, the font size and image dimensions dynamically adjust in
                accordance with their perceived interest to readers.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p>Amazon</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/">https://www.amazon.com.br/</a></p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/amazon.png" alt="FPP" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Amazon's homepage is a prime example of adhering to the Rule of Thirds. From the top to the middle of
                the page, they've neatly divided it into nine equally-sized sections, each housing text and content. In
                the middle section, there's a wide horizontal box for displaying rotating, smaller images. As you scroll
                down, they continue to follow this pattern with one row of three evenly spaced boxes followed by one row
                of the horizontal wide box. This consistent structure of three boxes, one horizontal box, and repeat,
                continues until you reach the end of their webpage.
